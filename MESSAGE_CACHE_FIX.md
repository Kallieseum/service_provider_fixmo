# ðŸ”§ Message Cache Fix - User Switching Issue

## Problem Fixed

When logging out and logging in with a different provider account, the Messages tab was showing conversations from the previous user instead of the new user's conversations.

---

## Root Cause

1. **MessageService Singleton** - The MessageService maintains a singleton instance that wasn't being cleared on logout
2. **Cached Conversations** - The conversations list was cached in component state and not refreshed when user changed
3. **No User Detection** - The messaging screens didn't detect when a different user logged in

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reset MessageService on Logout

**File:** `src/context/UserContext.tsx`

Added cleanup to reset the MessageService singleton when user logs out:

```typescript
const logout = () => {
    // ... existing cleanup ...
    
    // Reset MessageService to clear cached conversations
    try {
        const { MessageService } = require('../utils/messageAPI');
        MessageService.reset();
        console.log('ðŸ§¹ MessageService reset on logout');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to reset MessageService:', error);
    }
};
```

**What it does:**
- Clears the MessageService singleton instance
- Disconnects any active socket connections
- Removes cached API data

---

### 2. Detect User Changes in Messages List

**File:** `app/messaging/index.tsx`

Added user change detection with `useFocusEffect`:

```typescript
const currentUserIdRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
        checkUserAndRefresh();
    }, [])
);

const checkUserAndRefresh = async () => {
    const providerId = await AsyncStorage.getItem("provider_id");
    
    // If user has changed, clear conversations and reload
    if (currentUserIdRef.current !== null && 
        currentUserIdRef.current !== providerId) {
        console.log('ðŸ”„ Different user detected, clearing conversations');
        setConversations([]);
        setFilteredConversations([]);
        setLoading(true);
        
        // Disconnect old socket
        if (socketRef.current) {
            socketRef.current.disconnect();
            socketRef.current = null;
        }
        
        // Reinitialize for new user
        await initializeMessaging();
    }
    
    currentUserIdRef.current = providerId;
};
```

**What it does:**
- Tracks the current logged-in provider ID using a ref
- When screen is focused, checks if provider ID changed
- If different user â†’ Clears conversations and reloads
- If same user â†’ Just refreshes data

---

### 3. Detect User Changes in Chat Screen

**File:** `app/messaging/chat.tsx`

Added similar user change detection:

```typescript
const currentUserIdRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

useFocusEffect(
    useCallback(() => {
        checkUserAndRefresh();
    }, [])
);

const checkUserAndRefresh = async () => {
    const storedProviderId = await AsyncStorage.getItem("provider_id");
    
    // If user has changed, clear messages and reload
    if (currentUserIdRef.current !== null && 
        currentUserIdRef.current !== storedProviderId) {
        console.log('ðŸ”„ Different user detected in chat, clearing messages');
        setMessages([]);
        setLoading(true);
        
        // Disconnect old socket
        if (socketRef.current) {
            socketRef.current.disconnect();
            socketRef.current = null;
        }
        
        // Reinitialize for new user
        await initializeMessaging();
    }
    
    currentUserIdRef.current = storedProviderId;
};
```

**What it does:**
- Tracks current user in chat screen
- Clears messages when user changes
- Reinitializes socket connection for new user

## How It Works Now

### Logout Flow:
```
1. User clicks Logout
   â†“
2. UserContext.logout() is called
   â†“
3. MessageService.reset() clears singleton
   â†“
4. AsyncStorage is cleared
   â†“
5. Navigate to login screen
```

### Login with Different User Flow:
```
1. New user logs in
   â†“
2. New provider_id stored in AsyncStorage
   â†“
3. User navigates to Messages tab
   â†“
4. useFocusEffect detects different provider_id
   â†“
5. Conversations cleared
   â†“
6. MessageService reinitialized with new token
   â†“
7. New user's conversations loaded
```

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic User Switch

1. **Login as Provider A**
   - Go to Messages tab
   - Verify Provider A's conversations appear
   
2. **Logout**
   - Console should show: `ðŸ§¹ MessageService reset on logout`
   
3. **Login as Provider B**
   - Go to Messages tab
   - Console should show: `ðŸ”„ Different user detected, clearing conversations`
   - Verify only Provider B's conversations appear
   - Verify no conversations from Provider A

### Test 2: Chat Screen Switch

1. **Login as Provider A**
   - Open a conversation
   - Verify messages from Provider A's conversation
   
2. **Logout and Login as Provider B**
   - Open any conversation
   - Console should show: `ðŸ”„ Different user detected in chat, clearing messages`
   - Verify only Provider B's messages appear
   - Verify no messages from Provider A

### Test 3: Socket Cleanup

1. **Login as Provider A**
   - Go to Messages (socket connects)
   
2. **Logout**
   - Console should show: `ðŸ§¹ Disconnecting socket from messages list`
   - Verify no socket errors
   
3. **Login as Provider B**
   - New socket connection established
   - Real-time updates work for Provider B

## Console Logs to Look For

### On Logout:
```
ðŸ§¹ MessageService reset on logout
ðŸ§¹ Disconnecting socket from messages list
```

### On User Change Detection:
```
ðŸ”„ Different user detected, clearing conversations
ðŸ”„ Different user detected in chat, clearing messages
```

### On Socket Cleanup:
```
ðŸ§¹ Cleaning up socket connection
```

## Edge Cases Handled

âœ… **User switches before conversations load** - New user's data loads correctly  
âœ… **User switches while in chat** - Chat clears and reloads for new user  
âœ… **Socket connections** - Old socket disconnected, new socket created  
âœ… **Cached API data** - MessageService reset clears all caches  
âœ… **Multiple rapid logins/logouts** - User ID ref ensures correct state  

---

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/context/UserContext.tsx` - Added MessageService.reset() on logout
2. âœ… `app/messaging/index.tsx` - Added user change detection with useFocusEffect
3. âœ… `app/messaging/chat.tsx` - Added user change detection with useFocusEffect

---

## Benefits

âœ… **Privacy** - Previous user's conversations never show to new user  
âœ… **Security** - No data leakage between accounts  
âœ… **Performance** - Cached data cleared properly on logout  
âœ… **Real-time** - Socket connections properly managed per user  
âœ… **UX** - Smooth transition between different user accounts  

---

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
1. **On Logout:** MessageService singleton is completely reset
2. **On User Change:** Messaging screens detect new user and clear old data
3. **On Focus:** Screens check if user changed and reload if needed
4. **Socket Management:** Old connections properly disconnected

**Status:** âœ… Fixed - Messages now properly isolated per user account
