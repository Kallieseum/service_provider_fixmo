# Report System Enhancement - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The report system has been successfully enhanced to include appointment/booking ID selection and image upload capabilities as per the REPORT_SYSTEM_ENHANCEMENTS.md documentation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (report.tsx)

#### New Features Added:
- ✅ **Appointment/Booking Selection**
  - Conditional dropdown appears for "Complaint" and "Service Provider Issue" report types
  - Fetches user's booking history from `/api/appointments/customer/${userId}`
  - Displays formatted booking info: "Booking #123 - Service Title on MM/DD/YYYY"
  - Optional field (user can leave blank if not related to specific booking)

- ✅ **Automatic Provider Association**
  - When user selects a booking, `provider_id` is automatically populated
  - Helper text appears confirming provider will be notified
  - Provider information sent with report to backend

- ✅ **Image Upload Support**
  - "Add Images" button with camera icon
  - Shows counter: "Add Images (0/5)"
  - Users can select up to 5 images from gallery
  - Image preview grid with thumbnails (80x80px)
  - Each thumbnail has remove button (X icon)
  - Button disabled when 5 images reached
  - Helper text: "Max 5 images, 5MB each. Supported: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP"

- ✅ **FormData Submission**
  - Changed from JSON to multipart/form-data for file uploads
  - All form fields appended to FormData
  - Images appended with proper metadata (uri, type, fileName)
  - Removed Content-Type header (browser auto-sets for multipart)

#### New State Variables:
```typescript
const [appointmentId, setAppointmentId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [providerId, setProviderId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [images, setImages] = useState<ImagePickerAsset[]>([]);
const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState<Appointment[]>([]);
```

#### New Functions:
- `loadUserData()` - Enhanced to fetch both profile AND user's bookings
- `handleAppointmentChange()` - Auto-fills provider_id when appointment selected
- `pickImages()` - Opens image picker, enforces 5-image limit
- `removeImage(index)` - Removes selected image from array

#### New Interfaces:
```typescript
interface Appointment {
  appointment_id: number;
  scheduled_date: string;
  service_title: string;
  provider_first_name: string;
  provider_last_name: string;
  provider_id: number;
}
```

#### Updated UI Sections:
1. **Appointment Dropdown** (conditional):
   - Only shows for report types: 'complaint', 'provider_issue'
   - Populated from user's booking history
   - Auto-fills provider when selected
   
2. **Image Upload Section**:
   - "Add Images" button with camera icon
   - Image counter showing X/5
   - Preview grid with thumbnails
   - Remove buttons on each image
   - Helper text with size/format limits

3. **Submit Handler**:
   - Creates FormData instead of JSON
   - Appends all text fields (required and optional)
   - Appends appointment_id if selected
   - Appends provider_id if populated
   - Loops through images array and appends each
   - Success message now includes booking ID if applicable

### 2. New Styles Added:
```typescript
helperText: { fontSize: 12, color: "#666", marginBottom: 16, fontStyle: 'italic' }
imageButton: { flexDirection: 'row', borderWidth: 1, borderColor: "#008080", ... }
imageButtonText: { fontSize: 14, color: "#008080", fontWeight: "600", ... }
imagePreviewContainer: { flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap', gap: 8, ... }
imagePreview: { width: 80, height: 80, borderRadius: 8, position: 'relative', ... }
previewImage: { width: '100%', height: '100%' }
removeImageButton: { position: 'absolute', top: -5, right: -5, ... }
```

## Backend Requirements

### What Needs to Be Implemented:

#### 1. Update POST /api/reports Endpoint
```javascript
// Add multer for file upload
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ storage: multer.memoryStorage() });

// Update route to accept files
router.post('/api/reports', upload.array('images', 5), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const {
      reporter_name,
      reporter_email,
      reporter_phone,
      reporter_type,
      report_type,
      subject,
      description,
      priority,
      appointment_id,  // NEW: Optional booking reference
      provider_id      // NEW: Optional provider reference
    } = req.body;

    const files = req.files; // Array of uploaded files

    // Upload images to Cloudinary
    const imageUrls = [];
    if (files && files.length > 0) {
      for (const file of files) {
        const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(file.buffer, {
          folder: 'fixmo/reports',
          resource_type: 'image',
        });
        imageUrls.push(result.secure_url);
      }
    }

    // Save report to database
    const result = await pool.query(`
      INSERT INTO reports (
        reporter_name, reporter_email, reporter_phone, reporter_type,
        report_type, subject, description, priority, status,
        appointment_id, provider_id, attachment_urls, has_attachments
      ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, 'pending', $9, $10, $11, $12)
      RETURNING report_id
    `, [
      reporter_name, reporter_email, reporter_phone, reporter_type,
      report_type, subject, description, priority,
      appointment_id || null,
      provider_id || null,
      JSON.stringify(imageUrls),
      imageUrls.length > 0
    ]);

    const reportId = result.rows[0].report_id;

    // Send email to admin with images attached
    await sendReportEmail({
      reportId,
      reporter_name,
      reporter_email,
      report_type,
      subject,
      description,
      priority,
      appointment_id,
      provider_id,
      imageUrls
    });

    res.status(201).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Report submitted successfully',
      data: {
        report_id: reportId,
        has_attachments: imageUrls.length > 0
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating report:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

#### 2. Update Database Schema (if needed)
```sql
-- Check if columns exist
ALTER TABLE reports 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS appointment_id INTEGER REFERENCES appointments(appointment_id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS provider_id INTEGER REFERENCES service_providers(provider_id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS attachment_urls JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_attachments BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

#### 3. Create GET /api/appointments/customer/:userId Endpoint
```javascript
router.get('/api/appointments/customer/:userId', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { userId } = req.params;
    
    const result = await pool.query(`
      SELECT 
        a.appointment_id,
        a.scheduled_date,
        s.service_title,
        sp.first_name as provider_first_name,
        sp.last_name as provider_last_name,
        sp.provider_id
      FROM appointments a
      JOIN services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
      LEFT JOIN service_providers sp ON a.provider_id = sp.provider_id
      WHERE a.customer_id = $1
      ORDER BY a.scheduled_date DESC
      LIMIT 50
    `, [userId]);

    res.json({
      success: true,
      data: result.rows
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching appointments:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

#### 4. Update Email Template
Include booking and provider information in admin email:
- Show "Related Booking: #123" if appointment_id present
- Show "Service Provider: John Doe (#456)" if provider_id present
- Attach image URLs or embed images in email

#### 5. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install multer cloudinary
```

4. ⏳ Database: Schema updates for new columns
5. ⏳ Email: Template updates for booking/image info

## Next Steps

### For You (Backend Developer):
1. Install multer and cloudinary packages
2. Update POST /api/reports endpoint for file uploads
3. Create GET /api/appointments/customer/:userId endpoint
4. Update database schema (appointment_id, provider_id, attachment_urls)
5. Update email template to include booking/provider info
6. Test all endpoints with Postman/Thunder Client
7. Deploy to production

### For Testing:
1. Test report submission without appointment (should work)
