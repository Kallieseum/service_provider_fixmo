# Warranty Status Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a warranty period system that differentiates between "finished" (in-warranty) and "completed" (warranty expired) appointments.

## Workflow

### Service Lifecycle
1. **Scheduled** ‚Üí Provider accepts and appointment is scheduled
2. **On the Way (Confirmed)** ‚Üí Provider starts en route
3. **Ongoing (In-Progress)** ‚Üí Provider is working on the service
4. **In Warranty** ‚Üí Service finished by provider, warranty period active
5. **Completed** ‚Üí Warranty period expires (customer confirms or auto-expires)

## Implementation Details

### Status: `in-warranty`
When a service provider completes a service by clicking "Complete Service", the appointment status changes to `'in-warranty'`.

**Backend Update** (`src/api/booking.api.ts`):
```typescript
export const completeAppointment = async (
  appointmentId: number,
  finalPrice: number,
  repairDescription: string,
  token: string
): Promise<Appointment> => {
  return updateAppointment(
    appointmentId,
    {
      appointment_status: 'in-warranty',  // Changed from 'finished'
      final_price: finalPrice,
      repairDescription: repairDescription,
    },
    token
  );
};
```

### Frontend Changes (`app/provider/integration/fixmoto.tsx`)

#### 1. Status Colors
Added blue color for in-warranty status:
```typescript
const statusColors: Record<string, string> = {
  // ... other statuses
  "in-warranty": "#2196F3",  // Blue - warranty active
  completed: "#9E9E9E",      // Grey - warranty expired
};
```

#### 2. Tab Structure (5 Tabs)
The interface now has 5 separate tabs:
1. **Scheduled** - Shows `pending`, `approved`, `scheduled` appointments
2. **Ongoing** - Shows `confirmed` (on the way), `in-progress`, `ongoing` appointments
3. **Finished** - Shows `in-warranty`, `finished` appointments (active warranty period)
4. **Completed** - Shows `completed` appointments (warranty expired)
5. **Cancelled** - Shows `cancelled`, `no-show` appointments

**Why Separate Tabs?**
- **Finished Tab**: Provider can see all jobs still under warranty (their responsibility)
- **Completed Tab**: Provider can see all jobs where warranty has expired (fully closed)
- Better organization and tracking of warranty periods

#### 3. Visual Display
**Status Tag**:
- "In Warranty" - Shows in blue badge
- "Completed" - Shows in grey badge

**Warranty Badge**:
For appointments with `in-warranty` status, displays a special badge:
```
üõ°Ô∏è Under Warranty Period
```
- Blue background with shield icon
- Appears above the final price and repair description

#### 4. Appointment Details
When expanded, in-warranty appointments show:
- Warranty badge (shield icon + "Under Warranty Period")
- Final price
- Repair description

## User Experience

### Service Provider View
1. **Complete Service**: When provider clicks "Complete Service", status becomes "In Warranty"
2. **Finished Tab**: Shows only jobs with active warranty (in-warranty status)
   - Blue "In Warranty" badge
   - Shield icon indicator
   - Provider is still responsible for these jobs
3. **Completed Tab**: Shows only jobs where warranty has expired (completed status)
   - Grey "Completed" badge
   - Jobs are fully closed
   - No provider responsibility
4. **Warranty Indicator**: Visual shield icon shows warranty is active (only in Finished tab)

### Customer View (Future)
- Customer can confirm completion or report issues during warranty period
- After warranty expires (or customer confirms), status changes to "completed"
- Automatic expiry based on `warranty_days` field in database

## Database Schema

### Appointment Model
```typescript
{
  appointment_status: 'in-warranty' | 'completed' | ...
  warranty_days?: number | null     // Days of warranty coverage
  final_price: number               // Final adjusted price
  repairDescription: string         // What was fixed/repaired
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Distinction**:
   - In-Warranty = Provider responsible for issues
   - Completed = Job fully closed

2. **Provider Protection**:
   - Warranty period tracks provider's responsibility timeframe
   - Clear visual indicator for active warranties

3. **Customer Assurance**:
   - Customers know they're covered during warranty period
   - Can request fixes if issues arise within warranty

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. ‚úÖ Complete a service ‚Üí Status becomes "in-warranty"
2. ‚úÖ View in Finished tab ‚Üí Shows blue "In Warranty" badge
3. ‚úÖ Warranty badge displays with shield icon
4. ‚úÖ Final price and repair description visible
5. ‚è≥ Warranty expiration ‚Üí Status changes to "completed" (requires backend webhook/cron)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Warranty Timer**: Display days remaining in warranty period
2. **Customer Actions**: Allow customer to confirm/close warranty early
3. **Warranty Claims**: Add system for customers to report issues during warranty
4. **Auto-Expiration**: Backend cron job to auto-complete after warranty_days expire
5. **Notifications**: Alert provider when warranty is about to expire

   - Added `in-warranty` status color
   - Updated filtering logic for Finished tab
   - Added warranty badge component
