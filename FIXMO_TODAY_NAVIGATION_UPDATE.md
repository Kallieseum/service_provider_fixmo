# FixMo Today Navigation Update

## Issue
When clicking an appointment in the "FixMo Today" section on the homepage (`pre_homepage.tsx`), a modal would open showing the ongoing service details. The user wanted this to behave the same as the Appointments page (`fixmoto.tsx`), where clicking an appointment navigates to the full appointments page instead of opening a modal.

## Changes Made

### File: `app/provider/onboarding/pre_homepage.tsx`

#### 1. Updated Click Handler
**Before**:
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setModalVisible(true)}>
    <View style={styles.appointmentBox}>
```

**After**:
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => router.push('/provider/integration/fixmoto')}>
    <View style={styles.appointmentBox}>
```

#### 2. Removed Unused Modal
- Removed the `OngoingServiceDetails` modal that was displaying appointment details
- Removed the `modalVisible` state variable
- Removed the `OngoingServiceDetails` import (no longer needed)

#### 3. Kept Required Imports
- Kept `Modal` and `Pressable` imports as they're used elsewhere in the file for other modals

## Behavior

### Before
1. User clicks appointment in "FixMo Today" section on homepage
2. Modal opens showing ongoing service details
3. User must close modal to return to homepage

### After
1. User clicks appointment in "FixMo Today" section on homepage
2. User is navigated to the Appointments page (`fixmoto.tsx`)
3. Appointment list displays with full functionality:
   - Can expand appointment to see details, map, and location
   - Can see action buttons based on status:
     - "En Route to Fix" (for scheduled appointments on the day)
     - "Complete Service" (for ongoing appointments)
   - Can chat with client
   - Can see warranty status and completed service details

## Benefits
✅ Consistent UX - Both homepage and appointments page now have the same click behavior  
✅ More functionality - Full appointment page has more features than the modal  
✅ Better navigation flow - Users can use back button to return to homepage  
✅ Cleaner code - Removed duplicate modal component  

## Testing
1. ✅ Click appointment in "FixMo Today" section
2. ✅ Should navigate to Appointments page
3. ✅ Should show same appointment in the list
4. ✅ Can expand appointment to see details
5. ✅ Action buttons work correctly based on status
6. ✅ Can navigate back to homepage using Android back gesture or bottom nav
