# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue 1: Toggle Switch in My Services
**Status:** Already working correctly!

The toggle switch properly shows:
- **ON (green)** when service is active (`servicelisting_isActive: true`)
- **OFF (gray)** when service is inactive (`servicelisting_isActive: false`)

No changes were needed - it was already implemented correctly.

## ✅ Issue 2: Appointment Time Display
**Status:** Fixed!

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Removed time from all appointment displays
- ✅ Only showing dates now (no specific time)
- ✅ Added note: "(from 8:00 AM)" where applicable

### What This Means:
- Providers can attend appointments **anytime from 8:00 AM onwards** on the scheduled date
- More flexibility in daily scheduling
- No need to arrive at exact time

### Example:
**Before:** "Oct 15, 2025 | 2:30 PM"  
**After:** "Oct 15, 2025" or "Available on Oct 15, 2025 (from 8:00 AM)"

## Files Modified:
1. `app/provider/integration/fixmoto.tsx` - Date formatting
2. `app/provider/onboarding/pre_homepage.tsx` - Homepage display

## Test It:
1. Open FixMo Today screen
2. Check appointment dates - should show only date, no time
3. Open My Services
4. Toggle a service - should turn ON/OFF correctly
