## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Backend endpoint `/api/appointments/can-rate` is implemented
- [ ] Backend endpoint `/api/ratings` accepts provider ratings
- [ ] Database has `ratings` table with proper schema
- [ ] At least one completed appointment exists without rating

### Test Flow
1. [ ] Complete a service (appointment status → 'completed')
2. [ ] Open FixMoToday screen
3. [ ] Wait 3 seconds
4. [ ] Rating screen should appear automatically
5. [ ] Select star rating (1-5)
6. [ ] Optionally add comment
7. [ ] Click "Submit Rating"
8. [ ] Should show success alert
9. [ ] Should return to FixMoToday
10. [ ] Same appointment should not appear again

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Skip button works correctly
- [ ] Submit disabled without rating
- [ ] Character counter works (0-500)
- [ ] Background check doesn't interrupt open modals
- [ ] No errors when no unrated appointments exist
