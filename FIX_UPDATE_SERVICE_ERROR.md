# Service Update Issue - Quick Summary

## The Problem
You're getting this error:
```
ERROR: All fields are required (service_title, service_description, service_startingprice).
```

## Root Cause
**The issue is in your BACKEND, not the frontend.**

Your frontend is correctly sending only:
```json
{
  "service_description": "Updated description",
  "service_startingprice": 500
}
```

But your backend API is requiring ALL three fields including `service_title`, which shouldn't be editable.

## What Needs to be Fixed (Backend)

### Current Backend Code (WRONG)
```javascript
// ❌ This is incorrect
if (!service_title || !service_description || !service_startingprice) {
    return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: "All fields are required (service_title, service_description, service_startingprice)."
    });
}
```

### What It Should Be (CORRECT)
```javascript
// ✅ Only validate the fields that CAN be updated
if (service_description === undefined && service_startingprice === undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: "At least one field is required."
    });
}

// Don't allow title changes
if (service_title !== undefined) {
    return res.status(400).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Service title cannot be modified."
    });
}
```

## Frontend Status
✅ **Frontend is already correct** - no changes needed!

The frontend code in `myservices.tsx` only sends the editable fields:
```typescript
const updateData = {
    service_description: editDescription.trim(),
    service_startingprice: priceNum,
};
```

## Action Required
You need to update your **backend API controller** for the update service endpoint:

**File to edit:** Your backend service controller (likely something like `services.controller.js` or similar)

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/services/services/:serviceId`

See the detailed fix in `UPDATE_SERVICE_BACKEND_FIX.md` file.

## Files Updated
1. ✅ `UPDATE_SERVICE_BACKEND_FIX.md` - Detailed backend fix guide
2. ✅ `src/types/service.d.ts` - Added comments explaining constraints
3. ✅ Frontend code is already correct

## Quick Test
After fixing the backend, test by:
1. Open My Services screen
2. Tap "Edit Service" on any service
3. Change only the description
4. Save
5. Should work without requiring title

---

**TL;DR:** Your frontend is fine. Fix your backend validation to not require `service_title` in updates.
