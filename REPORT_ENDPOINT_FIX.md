# Report Endpoint Fix - Implementation Complete ✅

## Issue
Report submission was failing because the endpoint was incorrect. The code was trying to use provider-specific endpoints that don't exist.

## Solution
According to **SERVICE_PROVIDER_REPORT_SUBMISSION.md**, the backend uses a **single unified endpoint** for both customer and provider reports:

### Correct Endpoint
```
POST /api/reports
```

- **Authentication**: Not required (public endpoint)
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Differentiation**: Uses `reporter_type` field ('customer' or 'provider')

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Reports API Helper (`src/api/reports.api.ts`)
- ✅ New file following existing API patterns
- ✅ `submitProviderReport()` function for provider reports
- ✅ `submitCustomerReport()` function for customer reports
- ✅ Both use the same endpoint: `/api/reports`
- ✅ Removed authentication headers (public endpoint)
- ✅ Proper FormData handling with images
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. Updated Report Screen (`app/provider/integration/report.tsx`)
- ✅ Imported `submitProviderReport` from API helper
- ✅ Simplified `handleSubmit()` to use API helper
- ✅ Removed manual FormData construction from component
- ✅ Removed direct fetch calls
- ✅ Cleaner code with better separation of concerns

## Key Points from Documentation

### Endpoint Structure
```
❌ WRONG: /api/reports/provider
❌ WRONG: /api/reports/customer
✅ CORRECT: /api/reports
```

### Required Fields
```javascript
{
  reporter_name: string,      // Required
  reporter_email: string,     // Required
  report_type: string,        // Required
  subject: string,            // Required
  description: string,        // Required
  reporter_type: 'provider',  // Required for differentiation
  priority: 'normal',         // Optional (default: 'normal')
  reporter_phone: string,     // Optional
  appointment_id: string,     // Optional
  customer_id: string,        // Optional
  images: File[]              // Optional (max 5)
}
```

### Report Types
- `bug` - Bug Report
- `complaint` - Complaint
- `feedback` - Feedback
- `account_issue` - Account Issue
- `payment_issue` - Payment Issue
- `provider_issue` - Provider Issue
- `safety_concern` - Safety Concern
- `other` - Other

### Priority Levels
- `low` - Minor issues
- `normal` - Regular issues (default)
- `high` - Important issues
- `urgent` - Critical issues

## API Response

### Success (201 Created)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Report submitted successfully. Admin will review and respond via email.",
  "data": {
    "report_id": 123,
    "has_attachments": true
  }
}
```

### Error (400/500)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message here"
}
```

## Testing

The report submission should now work correctly. To test:

1. Navigate to Provider Profile → Report an Issue
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Optionally select an appointment (auto-fills customer info)
4. Optionally add images (up to 5)
5. Click Submit
6. Should receive success message with report ID

## Backend Requirements

According to the documentation, the backend should:
- ✅ Accept `POST /api/reports` endpoint
- ✅ Handle `multipart/form-data` for images
- ✅ Support up to 5 images per report
- ✅ Differentiate by `reporter_type` field
- ✅ Be a public endpoint (no authentication required)
- ✅ Upload images to Cloudinary
- ✅ Send email notifications to admin
- ✅ Return report ID on success

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/api/reports.api.ts` (New API helper)
2. **Modified**: `app/provider/integration/report.tsx` (Updated to use API helper)

## Notes

- The endpoint is **public** and doesn't require authentication
- Both customers and providers use the **same endpoint**
- The `reporter_type` field determines how the backend processes the report
- Images are optional and handled gracefully if they fail to upload
- Maximum 5 images per report, 5MB each
