### 3. Create Reschedule Backjob Screen ✅
**New File:** `app/provider/integration/reschedule-backjob.tsx` (649 lines)

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Availability Integration** ✅
   - Fetches provider's weekly availability schedule
   - Fetches existing appointments to detect conflicts
   - Calculates available dates based on:
     - Provider's active days (from availability API)
     - Existing bookings (scheduled, approved, confirmed, in-progress, ongoing)
   - Shows ONLY FREE dates (user's main requirement fulfilled!)

2. **Calendar Display** ✅
   - react-native-calendars integration
   - Green dots for available dates
   - Grayed out unavailable/booked dates
   - Custom theme with teal colors
   - Legend showing available vs unavailable

3. **Time Selection** ✅
   - Generates hourly time slots based on provider's availability hours

   - Tappable time slot grid
   - Selected time highlighted in teal

4. **Appointment Info Card** ✅

6. **Selected Schedule Display** ✅
   - Green confirmation card showing new date and time
   - Checkmark icon

7. **Reschedule Submission** ✅
   - Calls `rescheduleBackjob()` API
   - Passes `new_scheduled_date` and `availability_id`
   - Confirmation alert before submission
   - Success alert after completion
   - Loading state during submission
   - Navigates back on success

8. **Error Handling** ✅
   - Authentication checks
   - Availability not found handling

### 4. Connect Backjob Actions ✅
**Files Modified:** `app/provider/integration/fixmoto.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Imports** ✅
   - Added DisputeBackjobModal import (line 24)

2. **State Management** ✅
   - Added `disputeModalVisible` state (line 54)
   - Added `selectedBackjobId` state (line 56)

3. **Dispute Button Handler** ✅ (lines 578-584)
   - Sets selected appointment
   - Sets selected backjob ID
   - Opens dispute modal

4. **Reschedule Button Handler** ✅ (lines 585-599)
   - Navigates to `/provider/integration/reschedule-backjob`
   - Passes params:
     - appointmentId
     - backjobId
     - customerName (using getClientName helper)
     - serviceTitle (using getServiceName helper)
     - currentDate (formatted)

5. **DisputeBackjobModal Integration** ✅ (lines 660-674)
   - Added modal component after CompleteServiceModal
   - Props:
     - `visible` - controlled by state
     - `backjobId` - from selected appointment
     - `appointmentId` - from selected appointment
     - `onClose` - clears state and closes
     - `onSuccess` - closes modal and refreshes appointments list

**Result:** Both Dispute and Reschedule buttons are fully functional and connected to their respective screens/modals.

## 🎯 Additional Improvements Made

### En Route Button Fix (Bonus)
**File:** `app/provider/integration/fixmoto.tsx`
**Documentation:** `EN_ROUTE_BUTTON_FIX.md`

**Issue:** Appointments with "confirmed" (On the Way) status had no button to navigate to en route screen.

**Solution:** Added "View En Route" button (lines 505-545)
- Orange background (#FF9800) matching confirmed status
- Navigation icon
- Full appointment data passed to en route screen
- Error handling

**Result:** Providers can now access the en route screen when status is already "confirmed".
